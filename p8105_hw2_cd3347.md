### Problem 1

### Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
mr_trash_tidy = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1,
             range = "A2:N586") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  mutate(wheel_name = "mr_trash") %>% 
  relocate(wheel_name)
```

Do the same for the Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda datasets:

``` r
prof_trash_tidy = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 2,
             range = "A2:M108") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) %>% 
  mutate(wheel_name = "prof_trash") %>% 
  relocate(wheel_name)
```

``` r
gwynnda_tidy = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 4,
             range = "A2:L157") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) %>% 
  mutate(wheel_name = "gwynnda") %>% 
  relocate(wheel_name)
  gwynnda_cigs = gwynnda_tidy[1,10] + gwynnda_tidy[2,10] + gwynnda_tidy[3,10] + gwynnda_tidy[4,10] + gwynnda_tidy[5,10]
```

Combine all three datasets:

``` r
trash_wheels_tidy = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_tidy, prof_trash_tidy, gwynnda_tidy)
```

In the combined dataset, which includes data from Mr. Trash Wheel,
Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash wheel, there are 845 rows. One
key variable in this dataset is `weight_tons`, which describes the
weight in tons of trash collected by each dumpster receiving trash from
each trash wheel. Another key variable is `homes_powered`, which
describes the amount of homes that are powered by the electricity
generated by the incineration of the trash collected. Other key
variables include trash types, such as `polystyrene` and
`glass bottles`. The dataset also includes information like year, month,
and date. For available data, the total amount of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26. The total number of cigarette butts
collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 1.63^{4}.
